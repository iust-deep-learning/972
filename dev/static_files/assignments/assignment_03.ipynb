This is a fairly reasonable solution, and we use it to normalize the neural network's input. Now imagine the goal is to normalize some intermediate values in a deep neural network; Collecting values of some intermediate point in a neural network is almost impossible since the training algorithm can change them entirely. To overcome this issue, we can collect them over a mini-batch.  It will give us an estimated version of the mean and variance. This is why it is called Batch Normalization.

However, hidden units in neural networks have different distributions, and we don't really want them to all have the same distribution, So instead, we just scale and shift $x^{norm}_i$ with two variables $\\gamma$, $\\beta$. \n",
        "6. Another reason for the extra \"scale & shift\" step is that if we choose $\\gamma = \\sqrt{\\sigma^2_\\mathcal{B} + \\epsilon}$ and $\\beta = \\mu_\\mathcal{B}$ then $\\hat{x}_i$ will become $x_i$, So the optimizer can easily remove the batch normalization if it is sufficient for proper training.\n",

        "So if we assume that input size is 28 by 28 (mnist image size), the output of this encoder will be 8 feature maps and each of theme is in size of 4 by 4 (the output shape will be  (4, 4, 8) )\n",

        "There are various methods to conduct up-sampling operation, the first and the most simple method is to use  upsampling layers. An upsampling layer simply increases the size of input image using known interpolation methods (such as bi-linear or bi-cubic).\n",

        "Another way is using a convolution transpose layer (or known as deconvolution layer). In a normal convolution operation, we calculate the sum of the element-wise multiplication between the input matrix and kernel matrix. More concretely, the $h* h$ kernel is used to connect the $h^2$ values in the input matrix to $1$ value in the output matrix. A convolution operation forms a **many-to-one** relationship. On the other hand, a deconvolution operation is a  **one-to-many** operaion.\n",

We can reverse this process and simply use a convolution transpose layer with kernel size (3, 3) on top of an image with size (2, 2) to get an upsampled version by size (4, 4).
