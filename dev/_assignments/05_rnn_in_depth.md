In the final assignment, we'll build a deep memory-efficient recurrent neural network (RNN) which has residual LSTM cells and a Max-pooling layer. Also, we will try new Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) to improve its performance, and Finally, we will analyze an RNN-based stock predictor to find if it can be utilized in a real-world use case.

# Notes
- Students who audit this course should submit their assignments to be qualified for attending the rest of the sessions.
- Finding any sort of copying will zero down that assignment grade and also will be counted as two negative assignment points for your final score.
