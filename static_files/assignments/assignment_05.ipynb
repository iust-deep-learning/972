Of course not! Let's imagine a real-world example; Generally, a text classification corpus has a large number of sentences. However, their length roughly follows the normal distribution (say $\\mu = 40$). That is, most of our sentences are within the distribution mean range.

The problem here is rooted in the training algorithm, i.e., Backpropagation. Having more layers result in more dimmed, vanished error signals. Therefore, early layers will have no idea about what they are doing wrong since the received error signal is quite faded.\n",

It directly connects every single layer to the final output, which is considered as the primary source of the error signal. In other words, it makes the error signal propagation more efficient. In other words, it creates some kind of *highway* for neural network blocks to put their input on and receive high-quality error signal in the backward pass. In residual connections, ther input is added to the output along with neural network block result. i. e.  $y = F(x) + x$ where $F(x)$ is some neural network building block. \n",

This **cell** parameter could be anything such as LSTM, GRU, or even SimpleRNN cell. We will leverage this functionality to create a residual wrapper around the LSTM cell.

        "Having all parts ready, we can now build our advanced deep memory efficient RNN classifier. You should first implement a multi-layer LSTM bidirectional recurrent neural network with residual connections. Set its initial states to a trainable parameter. Then put Max-pooling layer on top of that in order to reduce all hidden states in a single vector, and finally Feed the computed vector into a multi-layer dense network to get the final predicted label. Here is a complete figure for our advanced model:\n",

        "1. Create an Embedding layer to convert word ids to thier corresponding embeddings. Use `layers.Embedding` class and remember to pass `mask_zero=True` in its paramters.\n",
        "2. Create the RNN part:\n",
        " 1. Unfortunately Keras `Bidirectional` layer is corrupted. You need to create two separate RNNs, one for forward (`fw_rnn = RNN(..., goes_backwards=False)`) and one for the backward direction (`bw_rnn = RNN(..., goes_backwards=True)`).\n",
        " 2. Make sure that you've created two sets of Residual LSTM cells (`fw_cells, bw_cells`) and two sets of initial states (`fw_initial_states, bw_initial_states`).\n",
        " 3. Then concatenate both hidden states to create the final output of a bidirectional multi-layer residual LSTM network (you may find `keras.layers.concatenate([...], axis=-1) useful`.\n",
        "3. Reduce hidden states to the max pooled version via our `MaskedGlobalMaxPooling1D` layer.\n",
        "4. Create a dense multilayer network to predict the output label from the max-pooled hidden state."

There is a technique caled **Byte pair encoding** which proposes training the embeddings on a bunch of common subword units (e.g. learning embeddings of ##solu and ##tion instead of the word solution). **BPE** creates a list of merges that are used for splitting out-of-vocabulary words. You can find the details of how to find these common subwords and how to find the optimal segmentation for each word here in the original paper  https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.07909 .  We are not going into the detail of the algorithm, instead we are going to just use it and compare the results with the regular case."
